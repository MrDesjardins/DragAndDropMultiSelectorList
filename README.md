#Description
This is the nuget package of the control used in this web project [Asp.Net MVC project of DragAndDropMultiSelectorWebSite](https://github.com/MrDesjardins/DragAndDropWebList).

It allows to drag and drop from a list of possible values (called available choice) to a list of selected choice. This replace the old basic two list with buttons that allow to move from one side to the other values.
